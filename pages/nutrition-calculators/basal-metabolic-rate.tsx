          What is the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your
          body functioning at rest. It is the equivalent of determining how much
          gasonline a car would consume at idle. BMR is also known as your
          bodyâ€™s metabolism; therefore, any increase to your metabolic weight,
          such as exercise, will increase your BMR.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          In a resting state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs,
          which include the heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous system, intestines,
          liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, up to of
          ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day is due to upkeep.
