          What is the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your
          body functioning at rest. It is the equivalent of determining how much
          gasonline a car would consume at idle. BMR is also known as your
          bodyâ€™s metabolism; therefore, any increase to your metabolic weight,
          such as exercise, will increase your BMR.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          In a resting state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs,
          which include the heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous system, intestines,
          liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, up to of
          ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day is due to upkeep.

        <Typography variant="h4" component="h2">
          What is Total Daily Energy Expenditure?
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how
          many calories you burn per day when exercise is taken into account. It
          is calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic Rate, then
          multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.{" "}
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Since your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at
          rest, it is necessary to adjust the numbers upwards to account for the
          calories you burn during the day. This is true even for those with a
          sedentary lifestyle. Our TDEE calculator uses the best formulas and
          displays your score in a way that&apos;s easy to read and meaningful.
